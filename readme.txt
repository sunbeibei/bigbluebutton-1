== Frequently Asked Questions ==


**Why is it giving an error about creating a meeting room?**

Make sure you are using BigBlueButton 0.8 or higher.

**What is this error: "Unable to display the meetings. Please check the url of the bigbluebutton server AND check to see if the bigbluebutton server is running."?**

You must make sure that your url ends with "/bigbluebutton/" at the end. 

So as an example:

* Wrong - "http://example.com/"
* Correct - "http://example.com/bigbluebutton/" 

**How can I improve security?**

You should enable the curl extension in php.ini.
